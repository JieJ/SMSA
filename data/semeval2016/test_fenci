goodluck jonathan may have managed the fight against boko haram terribly (as did yar'adua) but it wasn't deliberate <url>
<user> yakub arranged funds for the blast , dats an equal crime . ppl who loose their luvd ones knw d pain nd who dnt may god giv dem 1 .

<user> <user> <user> i'm a dumb , the missus booked a sofa at the electric tomorrow for ant-man . fancy it tomorrow ?
the most exciting part of paper towns was the instrumental version of fourth of july by fall out boy that played in the middle of the movie
no matter how disgusting hulk hogan is , he shouldn't be ruined for something he said in private . this societal trend is anti-1st amend

<user> new iron maiden album on the 4th of september~ has their longest eversong on it , which is why that reminded me .

catching up on wwe for the week thanks to the saturday night reruns . seth rollins is underappreciated .

new blog , nice conversations with friends (both staying in the deepest pits of hell) and going to see paper towns tomorrow . good shit .

<user> and i are gonna cry throughout the entire sam smith concert on monday .
<user> a response to bad blood may make the album ugly .

tons of preseason football and an important jays game with david price on the mound . ideal friday
full house on a friday for david price facing the yankees . that's the best sentence i have heard in a while #bluejays
i'm still upset with frank ocean , it's now august 14th
david price out of the 1st . omg you guys , ivan nova is a yankee ! #bluejays
go set a watchman still at number one . "yeah , but it's a sequel . mindfulness coloring book is totally original . " <url>
david wright grounds out in the 9th . was 2-for-5 today .
the sweet words of "rolling stone" by <user> is just what my friday needs . " .. that's where i'll be . " #musicforkath2015
watching the #bluejays vs the ny #yankees . jays are going for their 12th straight win tonight with david price on the mound . #mlb
<user> it's a disgrace that the game came out in japan on 28th march smh , naruto games come out within a week worldwide
when chuck norris decides to wake , he makes the sun rise .
what a pitch by #bluejays david price , striking out texteira unscathed with #yankees on 1st &amp ; 3rd #jays #cometogether
david price is lucky so far ... nowhere near the same guy as last saturday
so after watching straight outta compton (which was amazing) ice cube may have had one of the best diss tracks of all time ! lol

wayward driver puts johnson off the pga pace the horn may have been a welcome sound for dustin johnson . <url>

i may be in the minority here , but i rather enjoy watching david price play for the toronto blue jays
the blue jays are playing very well . they're scoring runs and david price is pitching like david price . 3-0 jays with one out in the 5th
1st time i saw zac brown band <user> <user> park , they opened for <user> . 2nite , they just covered "stay (wasting time)" . yay !!
6th strike out by david price . love the calm &amp ; trust from our pitcher #bluejays
welp , blue jays saying fuck pitch counts . david price back in for the 8th .
david price still out in the 8th ? gonna love this guy . #bluejays #cometogether
david price does not look happy getting sent off . he's allowed a hit each inning and left the game with the tying run at 2nd .
starting to bother me when people say "but it's david price" when it comes to pitch counts . don't want to burn him out before october .
ariana said that if i finish my mixtape before august ends , she's gonna sue frank ocean and that's probably the best motivation to finish it

i've been at the beach since friday and i still haven't listened to zac brown band . what is wrong with me ??
carly fiorina may very well be the smartest woman in the world . next to angela merkel , that is . <url>
<user> and he'll endlessly criticise muslims , christians , but never a word against the 3rd monotheistic religion: judaism .
fyi , tomorrow = release date for the pumpkinnnn !!! just called my local dunkin . can you say fiend ?!
it would have been cool if ice cube was staring out of the window at his neighbor when they showed him writing friday . #heymissparker
straight outta compton's success hopefully convinces new line cinema to give ice cube the right budget for the last friday movie .
just when i thought scott walker couldn't become any more monstrous , he goes and puts on those jeans <url>
rehab alert: david wright will continue his rehab assignment with us on tuesday . game vs . bradenton at 6:30 p . m . #mets

holy shit my brother is the coolest 7th grader in the entire world . he literally defended caitlyn jenner in front of his entire class . . .
i've said all along that scott walker's low-key style doesn't set the barn on fire but will win the day . <url>
david wright maybe returning in philly , you say ? makes me even more excited for my trip there next tuesday ...

brock lesnar live in-studio with mike and mike tomorrow is actually interesting to me . although the interview won't be . . .
<user> <user> agree ! i watch with my mum and it's our monday night show , that's not gonna happen anymore ! all bc of big brother
"what if we make a celebrity death match between bruce jenner vs caitlyn jenner??" ..... #officetalk #monday #hollywood
monday night raw in 1 hour john cena returns plus brock lesnar and the undertaker in the same building could go wild on usa network
listen , fyf is saturday . if the album isn't released (or addressed at least) by then ... it's over folks ! frank ocean isn't thinkin' bout you
tomorrow , scott walker will claim he defeated isis by misleading voters into ripping on teachers . #gopfail <user>

can't wait to hear the huge pop for brock lesnar tonight , despite the fact that he's facing the undertaker this sunday . #raw
dean ambrose on commentary is about the only thing i'm interested in right now . they should be saving these guys for sunday !
scott walker is getting so desperate , we may just see him borrowing rick perry's black frame eyeglasses .
ice cube one of the gods of nigga movies . he wrote friday , players club , and all about the benjamins , not to mention his acting credits
due to my boyfriend , ice cube , not actually being in the movie "straight outta compton" i will save my hard-earned cash for "last friday" .
if you are a real mma fan then ufc 194 will probably be the 2nd best card of the year i wouldn't put the rousey card in the top 10

<user> who do you have winning this sunday ? the undertaker or brock lesnar
seth rollins promo has been better than the first two hours of monday night #raw
as long as seth rollins leaves with his title sunday night then i'll be happy #raw #titlefortitle
seth rollins would have been a great champion if he does all things whatever he says every monday night on #raw in the middle of this ring
i hope that john cena wins the wwe world heavyweight champion for the 16th time &amp ; seth rollins is right the future is now . #titlefortitle

carly fiorina may not make it to be president but she would be an excellent secretary of state !... <url>

so if the 14th amendment could not protect a women's right to vote , why would it apply to gay marriage ? it wouldn't and doesn't .

not the best start to the 2nd set from murray , but our print editor is more focused on the fact that apparently both players "look scruffy"
murray's serve broken in 1st service game 2nd set . i'm not watching any more . he does my head in at times doing everything the hard way !
murray a set down and 3-0 down in the 2nd set and bookies are laying murray at evens ? ridiculous
<user> murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing djokovic
1 set up and has already broken murray in the 2nd . this is beautiful from kevin
<user> i'm not a huge fan myself but you know murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp ; 4th set knowing him .
<user> trash ol ? theyve looked excellent so far . trash rbs ? j-stew ran for 486 yards in the final 5 games last season , 2nd only to murray
<user> picking mvp in july is stupid .. wow were you marking off the days on your i luv kris bryant calendar to retweet this ? lol

super super super excited about gay pride on the 19th too mf hype .
if murray loses this 2nd set i'm pretty sure he won't win this .
murray's in major crisis here - 5 - 1 down in the 2nd set after losing the 1st ! scenes ! !

murray in real trouble now , down a break in the 3rd #usopen looking angry and frustrated
murray always struggles on louis armstrong . how pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to lose his mini break in the 1st ?
andy broken to start the 3rd set ; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time . murray's so done . #usopen
tomorrow is going to be my tenth time seeing shawn perform , i'm so lucky to be able to even once , this is so insane

15-30 on murray's serve , but the scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces . andy up 4-3* 3rd set .
ice cube is a genius tbf , didn't know he actually wrote the screenplay for friday

<user> it's why i love tennis . one minute looks like murray is down and out . next minute anything is possible ! c'mon <user>
yoga can help your child concentrate at school . research shows that the deep breathing exercises may improve children's focus .
murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th . sloppy along with a brilliant shot from anderson denies the break . #usopen
<user> definitely although i think if murray does enough to win the 4th set he'll go on and win it .
tomorrow kicks off 5$ class week ! come try out our new morning classes . slow burn yoga with barrett starts at 9:30 tomorrow am !
part of me hopes abbott does it b/c i believe it will blow up in his face if he singles out christians . it may take time for him to see why
it may only be the round of 16 , but holy cow ! don't tell that anderson and murray ! incredible match ! 3hrs and 40min so far . #usopen2015
with school starting tomorrow i'm gonna be missing out on so much with zayn this makes me so sad
might be watching monday night raw just to hear john cena's entrance song ...

anderson beats murray in the 4th round #usopen2015 excellent game . #wellplayed . <url>
murray can't be happy with that tie-break esp . what did he need to do better this match ? #usopen <url>
i think ice cube may be the greatest rapper ever ...
<user> <user> <user> <user> <user> murray will never win a slam again unless he changes . 2nd serve a joke

anyone else thinking chris evans is just doing this series of tfi friday before giving it to nick grimshaw ?! #scarythought
the 1975 may as well just call it a david bowie cover
is noel fielding having a chat on tfi friday or is chris evans going to keep on rabbiting another break "groan" !!!
i'm sure <user> are all a bit mr happy tonight seeing chris evans' t shirt tonight on tfi friday . #mrhappy <url>

lol , get a grip #royals fans . i can forgive the hrs , but he biffed that pitch to thor and then fell apart in the 4th <url>
grandy showing some real nixe range our there in rf , saving a 2-out double to end the top 5th . 12 straight retired by thor . #nymvskc
<user> 2nd visit to david bowie is last night and i already feel like i should be going again ! absolutely amazing exhibition ! thank you ! &lt ; 3
away . away . away . syndergaard peppering outside of the plate and then busts pitches inside . thor has found his groove . 5k . top 6th .
i have an uneasy feeling .. last 2 times i felt this way was day before the attitude article &amp ; when briana came to london .. i may be wrong tho
regardless of what happens- thor's recovery from the 1st and his middle innings here give me hope for the future #lgm #mets
<user> he was like david abbott's edgier younger brother . the elvis costello to david abbott's george harrison , if i may .
finally home from all this so called shopping in time to see thor finish up the 6th
thursday is thor's day and i'm sore from the thunder of stress that i'm under
people who know baseball know thor is the player of the game cause after the 2nd inning he started dealing and kept mets alive
put it in the books ! big games for the captain , thor , and granderson . let's got matz tomorrow ! #lgm
nice win , thor , captain america , and the falcon came up big , let's even this up tomorrow . #letsgomets
the first one is always the hardest . way to go thor !! looking to tie it up tomorrow night ! #lgm #metstwitter <url>
i knew thor would get the job done . matz on tomorrow , offense seems to be waking up , let's go mets !!! #lgm
here we go boys !!! great job by thor tonight !!!! and the captain !! huge spot for the long island kid matz tomorrow .
what's nice about cy pitching tomorrow night , he won't lose focus like ventura did after thor singled . we can't go to a game 7 with yv
win tomorrow and we get another shot at a 3 game set with harvery degrom and thor #wonthappenagain
i want to dress up as thor tomorrow and wear a syndergaard jersey .
i knew that escobar attacks 1st pitches , so there you go , hit this one .. thor is a real life hero . #lgm
thor is the man , this guy may have single handidly just turned this around with that first pitch
i like how thor is bragging about making esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings .
thor is a throw back kind of pitcher . i love it !!!! <url>
i don't understand the narrative that thor owned the game because of that first pitch . the royals got to him in the 1st &amp ; 2nd , right ?
i'm loving all these quotes from the cry baby royals about thor's 1st pitch to escobar . if i'm matz , i'm doing the same thing saturday .
<user> if escobar was hurt i would hope you would be calling for thor's suspension . if kc throws up tomorrow , you should have no prob
so proud of everyone tonight . it's not the end of the season it's the beginning of a new one . game next saturday against curtis 7 pm mt . t
<user> great game &amp ; way to make a statement on the 1st pitch . very bob gibson of u . beware of thor the hammer will come ! #lgm
<user> i hope you're ready for march 24 because that's when i transmute into dark souls danielle
<user> today's my 21st birthday and it would be awesome if i could get a birthday reply from thor !
chase fourcade with the 8 yard td run to give <user> a 7-0 lead over curtis with 5 seconds left in 1st quarter .
having a really hard time processing that connor howell sat on the curtis side at the game last night .
<user> be honest , if ventura had thrown 1st pitch like thor you all would be blasting him instead drooling on yourself ? #royals
congrats to prx for capping the 1st settlement on harvest ! eu settlements went to futilez , kittens , dark souls and frozen . #dastal
curtis is right: #sjsharks forwards coasting back to the d zone is not a formula for success . 3rd line didn't distinguish itself there .
i may well need therapy for what that guy just did to one of my all time favourite david bowie songs ... wtf was that !!! #xfactorliveshows
tfi friday was good in the 90s because it was new and chris evans was young . someone needs to tell him this is crap and dated .
i like moose but he should stop bitching about the thor pitch . fuck escobar , that's one way to get him back o stop swinging at the 1st pitch
i've only had 3 costumes come in tonight , and they were all marvel . thor , thor , and wolverine . <url>
drink a tank 7 every time they say "thor" on the #fox broadcast and see if you can make it 'til the 5th inning . #boulevardbeer
does it burn right now ? yeah . harvey tomorrow , degrom game 6 and thor in game 7 with everyone available . #gottabelieve #lgm #goodnight

<user> it may not be the best idea but *some* action is needed . school kids should not be calling for charlie hebdo to die <user>
<user> chris evans should lose his voice more often if it means we get more listenable breakfast shows like this monday and tuesday's .
morning everyone !! starting off our tuesday we have .. bee gees with i don't wanna be the one <url>
yo but i'm in there for the curtis night game on saturday camera ready
<user> thor just layed on the couch even he heard him . he sat up and juat ate by himself .. on the balcony .. right around him no rain
come visit curtis and the girls on this beautiful tuesday !! grab a patio seat for one of the last times or sit ... <url>

alright if you hate briana ok but like just ignore her don't call her names just leave her be if we ignore this it may just leave
<user> do think you'll make a video on dark souls 3 when it comes out ? "praise the sun"
<user> and also very importantly it was 40 years ago today that david bowie had his 1st no1 with space oddity ! #40spaceoddity
unless briana was as virgin- the only thing i can tell <user> is dna test ! she wouldn't be the 1st trying 2 trap a celebrity ...
just saying briana got pregnant when she had a bf in march/april and louis and eleanor had just broken up isn't that just fishy
thor the dog loves tuesday night d&amp ; d . <url>
ok but louis hasnt been seen with briana since like what march ???? he is never with her and he looks so uncomfortable when interviewers+
<user> <user> <user> love that camera close up of thor . can't wait for the first pitch tomorrow night
thor's going to make herrera pay tomorrow night . mets have the enforcer on the mound <url>
game over with a final score of 1-0 ! go bears ! we continue to thursday against todd beamer at curtis high school ... <url>
paps: this one if for the sun !! briana: *stands behind louis and poses* so not set up , nope nope nope , not one bit
in the paparazzi video where they take cliche for the sun you can clearly see louis not realising that there's briana behind him
briana may be pregnant but louis isnt the dad or atleast he is not excited about it you can obviously see it when he's been asked about it
thor may be 'sexy and he knows it' but i'm to sexy for my shirt .
saw trainwreck for the 2nd time &amp ; again found it &amp ; amy schumer brilliant as was the screenplay she wrote . mel brooks agreed . 100%
selena gomez presented amy schumer with an award and a heap of praise at the hollywood film awards on november 1 .
so briana is allowed to smoke but not allowed to take photos by fans because it may affect the baby okay then .
it may or may not be louis' baby that briana is carrying but i just wanna say that larry is real okay

<user> <user> guys chill we dont know shit about briana we may not like the fact she's here but calling her names is rude
like the bee gees , the 2nd time around , jesus/emmanuel will become a word jonathan said ... anti-fragile correct ... <url>

<user> like tomorrow if dana white tweeted what a glory fan he is , these same people would come running so hard they'd faceplant
<user> i'm supposed to be fling out to sharm on tuesday . i'm fed up of this . i went to paris a few days after the charlie hebdo attack
happy friday everyone ... starting off we have ... bee gees with country woman <url>
charlie hebdo may quite rightly enjoy freedom of speech , but to mock the deaths of over 200 people ? i think they have crossed a line
i have tickets to see the vamps on april 1st , should i try to do a fan project with signs to hold up ?

<user> sorry to hear that ! if things change before feb , lemme know ! i'll buy you a coffee and squee about kim and briana at you . *lol*
<user> <user> the 1st one is ok , rise of the silver surfer was terrible , but chris evans was hilarious &amp ; great in both .
the rejuvenation of tfi friday , ergo giving chris evans the opportunity to appear on tv more , is very disheartening .
amy schumer is on sky atlantic doing one of the worst stand up sets i have ever seen . and i've almost sat through 30 seconds of millican .
chris evans's son noah asks coldplay's chris martin a question on tfi friday and it's the cutest thing ever <url>

awesome amounts of support with our special bonus cast with <user> and <user> . go show them some love . back tuesday for dark souls
good morning :) george harrison - here comes the sun <url> via <user>
imagine if in the 70s , to fight the ira , mi5 had demanded to know every shop visited , book read , inquiry made ++ <url>
in age of a "global" charlie hebdo , it's clearer than ever: you can't have your laugh about everything with everyone <url>
odin , far-wanderer , grant me wisdom , courage , and victory . friend thor , grant me strength , and may both be with me .
study david bowie , james bowen and 2pac watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
<user> he calls terrorists his friends !! let's look at the first person he appointed . you guessed it , ira sympathiser !! 1st class traitor
lots of studying to do tomorrow so goodnight i love all you kiddos &amp ; my sunshines hayley atwell , chris evans &amp ; seb stan x
the thing is we don't know if that really is briana and plus the article was posted by a french site that's the equivalent of the sun
this is upsetting ! you may not like briana but spreading these false rumors that could ruin her life is horrible <url>
lean in close , the briana thing is also promotion . it's going to raise the sales on friday . you just wait and see . :)

8 november 1987 . an ira bomb exploded before a remembrance day service at the cenotaph in enniskillen , norhtern ireland , killing 11 people .
can't wait to see you guys in january at the vamps !! <user>
last face you want to see on remembrance sunday is tony blair , lying , horrible , corrupt twat . bush's bitch
i hope tony blair feels shit standing there at remembrance sunday , cause he's partly to blame for the deaths or so many soldiers in iraq
has to be said chris evans tfi friday is brilliant , great guests , brilliant bands and it always make me smile tbh
tony blair has a cheek being at remembrance sunday , seeing as he illegally sent many young men to their death illegally in iraq .
how can tony blair get invited at 'remembrance' sunday and there was no invite for the merchant navy by david cameron ? 'disgusting' !
tho i respect his decision , i don't agree with it . james mcclean may not necessarily be a supporter of ira . he said the poppys stand for . . .
on remembrance sunday my primary thought is of this very day in 1987-when the ira tried 2 murder members of my family for daring to remember
<user> i know for sure that briana's baby is not louis' ! he may have had sex with her but she did also with someone else sooo .. m
tony blair may be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people , but at least he bowed low enough , eh ? #remembrancesunday
some may find it tragic that i'm sat alone watching amy schumer and eating ben and jerries but personally i feel no shame
briana added tons of shit from sunday work day <url>
my movie <user> is going on tour starting this tuesday . screening followed by a thor performance . <url>
<user> ... so a sextape leaks , which may or may not be briana , and it automatically means management set it up and she's a pornstar ...
bitch a lot of people do sextapes but because it was briana yall are attacking her <url>
i'm very sure it is briana , but i do not see tattoos louis . i may not be able to defend if it's true . sympathy so much . #ohnobriana
tomorrow modest will show us louis and briana together . but you know this is a lie . #ohnobriana <url>
<user> thursday is thor's day , if you wanna get picky about it you're gonna need to rename the days of the week too
i think i may have just fell in love with <user> after watching "amy schumer: live . . . extended cut" on <user> .
<user> hey soph , the vamps are playing over <user> , that's why you may have not have seen the vista room option , ha !
if you do like amy schumer , i hope you went &amp ; saw her saturday bc after this ridiculousness , i highly doubt maine will be on list of faves .
never been more proud of my non gaming girlfriend than when she beat the asylum demon on dark souls on her 2nd attempt !
spirit week at my school ... star wars day is on wednesday and i'm in charge of bringing a game ... hope these scrubs like battlefront 2 ! &gt;:3
who went to the first amy schumer show on saturday ? anyone who would be willing to talk to me about it ? <url>
<user> <user> <user> #thetideonthehits i can't wait to see them live in april with the vamps and hear their music !!!!
<user> which may people think it is a bad game and that the major issue of dark souls games
<user> <user> funny how you call it "thursday" and don't believe thor was real .
why the hell are so many games releasing april-may ? the latest threat to r&amp ; c is dark souls 3 on the 19th of april :o crap
i wish the universe could see a david bowie film/musical scripted by <user> and directed by danny boyle . <url>
<user> "i'll tryeth to thor , but at this rate we may as well goeth to a restaurant." he looks at the time and smiles "we're +
<user> can you beat dark souls 2 before tomorrow ? maybe play both , as adventures in the apocalypse will seem nice in comparison .
briana should give birth on friday it would be good for album promo
thanks everyone who came and hung out through the challenge ! tomorrow i'm starting my first full playthrough of dark souls !
and the 17th is star wars day :d
danny boyle 'in grief' after david bowie says no to musical - don't do it <user> so proud ! <url>
i'll give you a hint , you wanna play it but you think it'll be too hard . "oh oh oh praise the sun . " "yes , dark souls . "
i liked a <user> video <url> here comes the sun lesson - beatles , george harrison
if you're truly my friend you'll play david bowie's greatest hits when i'm about to have my 1st kid

<user> shame on you and your government . as an ex tory you disgust me . a soldier arrested over bloody sunday . whilst ira walk free .

and i thought he was a relativist . "kerry sees 'rationale' in charlie hebdo murders , unlike friday's attacks in paris"
the fact he sees the rationale of charlie hebdo attack is why his policies are impotent against isis <url>
think the #ayto gang is gonna pull it off tomorrow ? i'm with briana . best timehop ever . <url>
so john kerry said this today and saturday i asked why no outrage over the charlie hebdo terrorist attack: they deserved it ?

<user> <user> no the ira grew out of oppression &amp ; internment &amp ; bloody sunday &amp ; ballymurphy &amp ; kids killed by rubber bullets &amp ;
if tony blair pipes up tomorrow someone shoot him . actually maybe he should and that will turn the vote !

kendrick and abel cleaning up grammy nominations , new office with dope views , and new latrell music on the way ... big monday
super-happy for kendrick today but the reality is he'll lose 90% of those nominations in february and then it's back to hating the grammys .
but ya . . . i'm just waiting for february so that cole and kendrick can drop their collabo album .
this may be an unpopular opinion , but i think that ever since the grammy's snubbed kendrick the first time , they just throwing awards at him
can't wait for the picture of kendrick holding 11 grammys to surface so i can be like "this is for the people in march calling tpab trash"

someone said that they might snub kendrick on all 11 nominations or he may get just 1 . if that happens then it's clearly rigged .
