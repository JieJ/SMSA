paper towns is released in the uk tomorrow and i have nobody to watch it with . *cries eternally*
is there really any point in dustin johnson playing the 4th round of a major ?
i see 'sunday major dustin johnson' showed up today . +4 after the first ... #roughstart #fightback #pgachamp
poor dustin johnson ! this is going to be special . c'mon rose #pgachampionship
gonna be a long day for dustin johnson . . . starts the final round of the #pgachampionship with a quadruple bogey on the 1st hole .
dustin johnson runs out of coke by the 4th round
dustin johnson isn't the first guy to drop 22 places in a major on sunday , but it usually takes more than 1 hole . #pgachampionship
apparently paper towns is out tomorrow , in case you didn't quite get the memo ..
dustin johnson is about to get that 'tony romo in the 4th quarter' treatment .
dustin johnson has blew it . quadruple bogie at the 1st
i could gie dustin johnson a game going by the way he played the 1st !!
owl dustin johnson always gets himself into contention . then goes on a coke binge come the saturday night , and then totally blows up .
wonder whether it'd be a good idea if sis and i went to the movies tomorrow to see paper towns .
you can't make this up . dustin johnson starts his round with a snowman 8 quadruple boget on the 1st .
christ , i get it . paper towns is out tomorrow .
<user> hey ryan ! would you consider having on audrey middleton from cbs's big brother ? she made history being the 1st transgender on it !
as sure as the sun coming up everyday , dustin johnson implodes at a sunday major #pgachampionship
<user> <user> talking about muslims tomorrow morning ? are you sure it's the right show ? ?
i'm going to take a wild guess and say that paper towns is out tomorrow ?
who's going to sam smith's concert tomorrow ??
dustin johnson got an 8 on the first hole today , so it must be sunday .
super eagles coach , sunday oliseh says it is wrong to tag some players 'home-based , ' even as they ply their trade in the domestic league .
the signs on dunkin doors should say see you tomorrow instead of see you soon
if you stare directly at the sun , it merely burns your retinas . if you stare directly at chuck norris , you die .
#brewers ryan braun records his 10th career game with at least 5 rbi
frank gifford past away 08/09/15 . helping to light up the camaraderie on monday nights was only a part of what he'll be remembered (next
<user> gerard way , green day , nirvana , memphis may fire , we the kings , the foo fighters , union j , fall out boy , jordan sweeto ect .
dustin johnson would have several majors under his belt if only the thursday / friday rounds counted
its fire how in #straightouttacompton they show ice cube working on " friday" the movie b4 it ever existed in real life
it didn't take long for dustin johnson to have his sunday meltdown at the pga: <url> <url>
i need dustin johnson to remember who he is and that it's sunday , not thursday
dustin johnson would be -13 , tied for 5th if he simply bogeyed the first instead of puttin' up a snowman .
let the romance rumors continue ! in a sneak peek clip from this sunday's brand new episode of i am cait , caitlyn jenner heads over to bff
heck of a bounce back by dustin johnson to be under par after an 8 on the 1st #pgachampionship #whatcouldhavebeen
after going +5 on the 1st 4 holes (including a quadruple bogey on 1) , dustin johnson is -7 for his next 8 .
i think if i wake up one day and realize that i am not married to frank ocean i may lose my mind .
in 4th year when nowt was more important than nirvana i wrote a bit about why kurt cobain didn't kill himself lol <url>
... i know the sexy pick for nl roty is kris bryant . 257/16/66 1st rd ., but matt duffy ? . 310/10/59 18th rd . ... duffy has more hits overall ...
"mar , do you know that caitlyn jenner still has a ball sack?" - my 7yr old cousin ..
not often when you see dustin johnson going low on a sunday
what a joke of a scorecard by dustin johnson . -4 today with a quadruple bogey 8 on the par 4 1st . 2 eagles on the back 9 . #pgachampionship
if dustin johnson had pared the 1st hole he'd be 17 under right now
if dustin johnson makes par at the 1st instead of quad , we have a ball game . he's still fun to watch
dustin johnson's scorecard is ridiculous . starts with a snowman on the 1st hole . since then hes added 2 eagles and 4 birdies
brawler martin maulers came all the way from prince george to get #lockedin for their 20th anniversary . can they get out before their 21st ?!
wtf !!! frank ocean's album has been out since june 30th and i'm just finding out !!! how ??????
#uspga man totally oblivious to dustin johnson's tee shot landing beside him at the 17th . #foreleft
dustin johnson is -8 over the last 14 holes . oh for that quad on the 1st . . . .
i have no idea what to wear tomorrow to the sam smith concert .. need to go shopping but hate shopping . ugh
kudos to dustin johnson for finishing with a 69 after starting the day with a quadruple bogey . an 8 on the 1st could've led to an 80+ easy .
dear <user> any chance you can pay out 7th place on dustin johnson after his comeback today #justiceforjohnsonbackers
<user> only thing that is guaranteed of tomorrow is the finishing off of any christians left in the m . e ... hazel wallah you're giving
i know it's just preseason but do i still get free dunkin tomorrow , or nahhhh ?
just your typical sunday ... spieth and day there in the end , while dustin johnson falls apart in his final round
what if caitlyn jenner is actually the worlds ultimate april fools joke ?
ryan braun hit a grand slam and finished with five rbi in sunday's 6-1 win over the phillies .
send me lwanga's hw packet and i will buy you dunkin tomorrow morning
dustin johnson flies out of the blocks at every major , but he simply cannot get it right on a sunday .
i hope tomorrow is the last raw where seth rollins is wwe champion for at least a year .

tomorrow all the headlines are going to be about how nicki had such an ~aggressive outburst~
i start school tomorrow and i'm here watching kanye rant , miley and nicki go at it and tori kelly blow the roof out of the #vmas
kanye west may not technically be a millennial , but i think he'd agree he's part of the greatest generation of all time . #vmas #vmabert
final thought: at some point kanye west sat down his wife kim kardashian and said he wanted to run for president . what a time to be alive . . .
yeah that's just what i wanted ... hearing about kanye west non-stop heading into a monday . #not
